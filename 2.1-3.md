Linear-Search(A, v)
  for i = 1 to A:length
    if v == A[i]
      return i
  return NIL

Loop invaraint:
  At the start of each iteration, the element v is not in the range A[1..i-1].

Proof:
  Initialization: Initially v cannot be in the empty range A[].
  Maintenance: v is not in the range A[1..i-1]. If v is in A[i] the loop terminates. If it is not, then v is not in A[1..i].
  Termination: If v is found during the for loop, it is returned by the algorithm. If the loop terminates without finding v, it returns NIL. In that case i=A.length+1 = n+1. The loop invariant states that A[1..n] does not contain v. Therefore the algorithms is correct.
