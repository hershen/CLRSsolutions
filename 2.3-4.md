If n=1, then it takes constant time to add an element to an empty array.
In case n>1, we have to do Insertion-Sort on the n-1 element array, then add element A[n] into the sorted n-1 array:

T(n) = \Theta(1) if n=1
       T(n-1) + C(n-1) if n>1

Where C(n-1) is the time to insert an element into the sorted n-1 element array. In general C(n-1) takes \Theta(n) time.
