Loop invariant: At the start of each iteration, the elements in the range A[1..i-1] are sorted, and are smaller or equal than the elements in the range A[i..n].

Needs to run for the first n-1 elements because when i=n-1, the last element A[n] is larger than the elements in the range A[1..n-1], therefore the whole array is sorted.

Best-case: the array is sorted, for each element the rest of the array is searched: $$\Theta(n^2)$$
Worst-case: For each element the rest of the array is searched: $$\Theta(n^2)$$
