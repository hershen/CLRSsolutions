Input: 2 sequences A, B of n-bit binrary numbers.
Output: A n+1 element sequence C which is the sum of A and B.

Note - we assume that A[0], B[0] are the least significant bit and A[n], B[n] are the most significant bits.

  let C[1..n+1] be a new sequence
  carry = 0
  for i=1..A.length
    C[i] = A[i] xor B[i] xor carry
    if A[i] + B[i] + carry >= 2
      carry = 1
    else
      carry = 0

  C[i] = carry
  return C
